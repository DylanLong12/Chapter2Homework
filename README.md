This package consists of 1 superclass and 5 subclasses.
All 5 subclasses inherit the generic fields that were given to the superclass.
All 5 subclasses also have their own unuiqe fields.
I tried to make this program confusing to really understand the relationship between superclasses and "this" instance key word.
